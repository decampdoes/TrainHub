# TrainHub
Models a trian hub, handling incoming and departing trains
To run, download the zip file, then unzip and save the files. There are four different "trains" of data that can be processed. You can start with an empty train hub ("java TrainHubMain") or you can start the program with trains by adding arguments. To do this, type: "java TrainHubMain -f trainFileName". Train file names are "Train1", "Train2", "Train3" and "Train4".
